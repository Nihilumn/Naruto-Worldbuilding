# Guard Squad

## Overview
Defensive units tasked with the protection of specific locations or individuals. Unlike Assault squads, they do not pursue enemies; their goal is to maintain an impenetrable perimeter and ensure the safety of their charge at all costs.

## Standard Composition
*   **Frontline Fighter:** Takes the brunt of attacks and shields the squad or the person/thing being guarded. They are the first line of defense.
*   **Tactical Support:** Provides strategic support through traps, defensive barriers, or counterattacks. They enhance the overall defensive capabilities of the squad.
*   **Reconnaissance Expert:** Maintains vigilance and watches for potential threats. They have heightened senses and are responsible for early warning and detection of enemies.
