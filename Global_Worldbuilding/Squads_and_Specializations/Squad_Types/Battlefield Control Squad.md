# Battlefield Control Squad

## Overview
These squads specialize in area denial and environmental manipulation. Rather than focusing on single targets, they reshape the terrain to disadvantage entire enemy armies, funneling opponents into traps or separating their formations.

## Standard Composition
*   **Terrain Manipulator:** Specializes in altering the battlefield environment using earth, water, or other nature-based jutsu. They create barriers, traps, and obstacles to control enemy movement and provide strategic advantages for their squad.
*   **Tactical Support:** Analyzes the battlefield and provides real-time strategic guidance. They direct the placement of terrain modifications, coordinate movements, and adapt plans based on the evolving situation.
*   **Disruption Specialist:** Focuses on disrupting enemy formations and strategies. They use techniques that cause confusion, limit visibility, or otherwise hinder the enemy’s ability to fight effectively.
