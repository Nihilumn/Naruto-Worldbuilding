# Extraction Squad

## Overview
Extraction Squads are deployed to retrieve assets—be they captured personnel, intel scrolls, or VIPs—from hostile environments. They prioritize speed and mobility, designed to get in, secure the package, and get out before the enemy can react.

## Standard Composition
*   **Extraction Leader:** Coordinates the mission and ensures the squad follows the plan. They make quick decisions to adapt to changing situations during the extraction process.
*   **Stealth Expert:** Gets into secure or hostile areas to reach the target. They have skills in bypassing security measures and moving undetected.
*   **Evacuation Specialist:** Manages the safe and swift removal of the target from the extraction point. They plan and execute the escape route, often dealing with obstacles and enemy forces.
