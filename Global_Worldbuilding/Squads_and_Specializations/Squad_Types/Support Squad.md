# Support Squad

## Overview
A force multiplier unit. Support Squads rarely operate alone; they are attached to larger platoons to enhance the capabilities of standard combat units through buffs, healing, and barrier techniques.

## Standard Composition
*   **Medic:** Provides medical assistance to injured squad members. They can heal wounds, perform surgeries, and ensure the squad's health during extended missions.
*   **Enhancer:** Uses jutsu to enhance the abilities of teammates, such as increasing strength, speed, or defense. They provide boosts that can turn the tide in difficult situations.
*   **Defensive Specialist:** Creates barriers, shields, and other protective measures to safeguard the squad. They focus on mitigating enemy attacks and ensuring the team's safety.
