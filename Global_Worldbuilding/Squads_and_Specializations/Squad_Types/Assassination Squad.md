# Assassination Squad

## Overview
Assassination Squads are highly specialized units tasked with the silent elimination of high-value targets (HVT). These squads operate with extreme prejudice, prioritizing stealth and lethality over open combat. They are often deployed deep behind enemy lines or within political environments where discretion is paramount.

## Standard Composition
*   **Stealth Expert:** Masters in stealth and infiltration techniques. They approach targets silently and are adept at covert operations.
*   **Precision Striker:** Focuses on high-damage, targeted attacks to eliminate key targets quickly. They often use specialized weapons or jutsu designed for quick kills.
*   **Evacuation Specialist:** Ensures the squad's safe withdrawal after the assassination. They can create distractions, design traps, cover the retreat, and navigate through hostile territory without being detected.
