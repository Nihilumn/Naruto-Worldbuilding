# Stealth Expert

## Description
Masters of infiltration and noise suppression. These shinobi specialize in lowering their presence to absolute zero, bypassing sensory nets, and moving through hostile territory unseen.

## Operational Variants
While the base skill set remains constant (hiding), the application shifts based on the squad:
*   **Assassination Context:** Focuses on *Proximity Infiltration*. Getting close enough to a target to strike without alerting guards.
*   **Sabotage Context:** Focuses on *Object Infiltration*. Bypassing physical security measures to plant explosives or tamper with machinery.
*   **Extraction Context:** Focuses on *Pathfinding*. Finding the "blind spots" in enemy patrols to lead a VIP out safely.
