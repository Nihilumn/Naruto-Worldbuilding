# Specialization Overview

## Administration
All specialized roles listed below are officially defined, trained, and administered by the **Shinobi Field Forces (SFF)**. While a Shinobi may possess an aptitude for multiple areas, they must hold an official certification from the SFF to be deployed in that specific capacity within a structured squad.

## Role Distinctions & Contrasts
To ensure operational efficiency, it is crucial to understand the differences between roles that may appear similar to the untrained eye.

### Demolitions vs. Terrain Manipulation vs. Disruption
While all three deal with altering the state of the battlefield, their methods and goals differ significantly:
*   **Demolitions Expert:** Focuses on *destruction* with minimal precision regarding the aftermath. Their goal is to remove obstacles or assets using explosive force (e.g., blowing up a bridge).
*   **Terrain Manipulator:** Focuses on *reshaping* with high tactical control. They create advantages (walls, pits, elevation) to funnel enemies or protect allies. This requires sustained chakra control rather than one-off explosive release.
*   **Disruption Specialist:** Focuses on *chaos* and *interruption*. They do not necessarily destroy physical objects but target the enemy's ability to coordinate (blinding sensors, jamming comms, creating flash-bang effects).

### Tracker vs. Reconnaissance Expert
*   **Tracker:** A "Hunter." They focus on a specific target (person or object). Their skills are directional, like finding where X went.
*   **Reconnaissance Expert:** An "Observer." They focus on an area or a force. Their skills are wide-range data collection: identifying enemy numbers, camp locations, and patrol routes without engaging.

### Medic vs. Tactical Support (Healing)
*   **Medic:** Performs biological repair (surgery, antidote administration, cell regeneration). They fix the damage *after* it happens.
*   **Tactical Support:** Often provides preventative measures (shields, barriers) or temporary stamina restoration. They keep the fighter moving *during* combat, but cannot replace a dedicated Medic for serious injuries.
